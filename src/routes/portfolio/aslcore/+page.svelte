			American Sign Language (ASL) has historically lacked specific signs to communicate advanced
			academic subjects. This leads to additional barriers for Deaf and hard-of-hearing people
			learning and working in these disciplines.
		</p>
		<p>
			ASLCORE was formed as a project where Deaf content experts (professionals in their respective
			fields) would work in sessions Deaf Sign Masters to conceptualize and develop new signs for
			academic terminology. Once these signs are developed, the Sign Masters would model the new
			signs on video, and the videos would be organized into an online lexicon, to allow people
			around the world to learn and use these new linguistic tools.
		</p>
		<p>
			ASLCORE was funded and supported by the Department of Access Services (DAS) at the Rochester
			Institute of Technology (RIT). When I joined the project, the online lexicon consisted of only
			one academic branch, Philosophy, and it was displayed in a WordPress blog. After initial
			meetings with project leader Miriam Lerner and the rest of the team, it was clear that to
			grow, the project needed its own website, to allow the content within to shine.
		</p>
		<p>
			I designed the website from scratch to address the specific needs of the team. I worked for
			ASLCORE from November 2016 to the end of 2019, and over the course of this time, I functioned
			as both the designer and developer of the project, designing the interface and graphical
			materials, as well as coding and maintaining a custom front- and backend to allow for the
			scaling the project would need.
		</p>
		<p>
			My work was not limited to website responsibilities. I was also the dedicated videographer,
			which meant every time new signs were developed, I managed the camera work, lighting, shot
			logging, editing, keying, branding, and rendering of every single video that made it to the
			site. Our set-ups began relatively basic, with me bringing in some of my own lighting
			equipment and using my own camera. As the project grew, DAS supplied us with high quality
			cameras, lighting, and dedicated studio space, which drastically increased the production
			value we were able to output.
		</p>
		<p>
			The WordPress blog contained approximately 120 entries for Philosophy. By the end of 2019,
			ASLCORE totaled 2,056 entries across 10 different academic branches. People have used ASLCORE
			resources across the globe, and I’m honored to have been a part of bringing these resources
			into the world.
