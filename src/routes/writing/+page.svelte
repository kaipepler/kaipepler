		One of the things I love most about design is that there are endless opportunities to learn. The
		field touches so many other disciplines: Color science. Typograpy. Data visualization.
		Psychology. Writing. Accessibility. Animation. Programming. Motion graphics. These are just a
		few of the fields to which you could easily devote your whole life.

		Over the years Iâ€™ve collected hundreds of links to the works of brilliant people who have shared
		their content with the world. This page is a place where I write articles to reference those
		works, and put my own learnings back into the community.
