	<h1>Writing</h1>

	<p>
		A place where I write and collect resources from across the internet. Topics include UX, color
		theory, typography, design systems, accessibility, frontend development, and more.
	</p>

	<p>
		My intent with this page is to publish a collection of evergreen documents, updating and adding
		to them over time.
