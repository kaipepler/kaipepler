# Hello Everyone!

I’m Kai Pepler, a UX designer and visual artist. I have over 10 years of experience designing
UI, and over the course of my career I’ve worked in information design, web development,
videography, motion graphics, data vizualization, color science, accessibility, and design
strategy.

This is my personal website, where I host my portfolio and write articles about design-adjacent topics.
