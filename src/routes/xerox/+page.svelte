			Since 2022 I’ve worked as a UX designer within Xerox’s Experience Design Group (EDG). I’m part
			of an amazing team in charge of designing <a href="https://www.xerox.com/en-us/services"

		<div class="tl-date"><h3>2025</h3></div>
		<div class="tl-desc">
			<p>
				In 2025 I temporarily shifted focus from digital services to working with our design
				strategy team. I helped architect a migration to Figma, including building out a new set of
				interconnected libraries from scratch that perfectly reflect the guidance in our interface
				design system.
			</p>
			<p>
				The toolkits we built are highly sophisticated, making use of cutting-edge Figma features,
				and are designed support all our department’s needs, including different themes, modes,
				screen scale factors, spec templates, and more.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="tl-date"><h3>2024</h3></div>
		<div class="tl-desc">
			<p>
				Since 2024 I’ve functioned as one of our department’s subject matter experts on
				accessibility. My focus has been on furthering accessibility initiatives across our
				department, ensuring that the resources we deliver remove barriers of access for people of
				differing abilities.
			</p>
			<p>
				To this end, I’ve run workshops to train our designers on the importance of delivering
				accessible design specifications, I answer daily questions from teams across the department,
				and I've collaborated with our in-house frontend developer to improve the accessibility of
				the React code we deliver to project teams across the company.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="tl-date"><h3>2023</h3></div>
		<div class="tl-desc">
			<p>
				I collaborated with our design system team to improve the color scales we use for data
				visualization. The new scales are used across company reports and dashboards.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="tl-date"><h3>2022</h3></div>
		<div class="tl-desc">
			<p>
				Since 2022 I’ve been the design lead for
				<a
					href="https://www.xerox.com/en-us/services/managed-print-services/printer-analytics-insights"
					>Managed Print Services Advanced Analytics</a
				> (MPS AA), a platform dedicated to providing data visualization and reports on the performance
				of massive fleets of client printers.
