	<h1>Writing</h1>

	<p>
		One of the things I love most about design is that there are endless opportunities to learn. The
		field touches so many other disciplines: Color science. Typograpy. Data visualization.
		Psychology. Writing. Accessibility. Animation. Programming. Motion graphics. These are just a
		few of the fields to which you could easily devote your whole life.
	</p>
	<p>
		Over the years Iâ€™ve learned from the work of of brilliant people who have shared their content
		with the world. This page is a place where I write articles to reference those works, and put my
		own learnings back into the community.
